Just my own version of the common PlayStation 1 MM3 ModChip

[I plan to provide this fully flashed and assembled on my ebay store](https://www.ebay.com/usr/hh_point)

This is a basic 1 layer modchip pcb I routed to be used with the common [PIC12C508A](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC12C508A-04-SM/273437) integrated circuit.

The goal was to produce something with the smallest footprint possible but still within reason to hand solder.

I recommend installing this modchip with Kynar wire but any standard hookup wire should work without issues. 
Kynar wire is thinner and somewhat easier to solder to this modchip due to the smaller than normal pad size.

I've tested and confirmed this product working in the following consoles:
- SCPH-1001
- SCPH-5501
- SCPH-7501

Chip flashed with MM3 files provided by the [PSX Modchip Pack found on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/PSXModchipPack)

The chip can be flashed with any of the firmware found in the PSX Modchip Pack but I have only tested and used the MM3 NTSC-U hex

Install diagrams provided by the PSX Modchip Pack as well, these installation diagrams are clear and easy to follow but I will provide my own installation photos of the modchip for the models I have access to when able.
